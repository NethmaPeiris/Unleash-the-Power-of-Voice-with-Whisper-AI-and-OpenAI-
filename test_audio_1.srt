00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm interested and I think everybody is interested in the three laws of robotics. Could you explain those?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, back in 1939, I began writing robot stories. And by the time I'd written two and three, there was a pattern in these stories which John Campbell, the editor of Astounding Science Fiction and my literary father, pointed out to me.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He said, I was having my robots behave as though they were guided by three laws.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The first law was that a robot couldn't hurt a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The second law was that a robot had to obey orders given it by human beings provided that didn't conflict with the first law.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And the third law was that a robot had to protect its own existence except where that would conflict with the first two laws.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And after that, I always used them and the stories evolved out of those three laws, out of the mutual contradictions, out of the ambivalences, the incongruities and so on.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The interesting thing is that scientists say that when robots are built that they may be built according to these laws and also that almost all science fiction writers have adopted them as well in their stories.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's true about the science fiction writers adopting them. They are not taken for granted. No writer actually quotes them except myself.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But the readers are so used to it now that they know it and they take it for granted.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And somebody writing in an architectural journal pointed out that these laws hold for tools generally.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Number one, a tool must be safe to use. And two, provided it is safe to use, it's got to do what you want it to do.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And third, provided it is safe to use and it does what you want to, it's got to last.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But could your three laws of robotics be overloaded on the side of humanism?

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There are those who believe that the machines we create are going to be Frankenstein's.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, of course, the three laws of robotics were originally invented by me in order to avoid the Frankenstein motive.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because before I wrote my stories, most robot stories were filled with this Frankenstein bit about the robot destroying its creator.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There are some things that men were not meant to know.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,000
However, having worked with the three laws for now for 35 years, practically, I was asked to write a robot story to end all robot stories.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I wrote one in which robots became so intelligent that by any reasonable definition, they define themselves as human beings, you see.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So that now the three laws of robotics became the three laws of humanics.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And we were right back to the Frankenstein motif.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I received letters from readers saying, does this mean you're never going to write any more robot stories?

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And I wrote back saying, don't worry, if I think of a good robot story, I'll write it anyway.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You know, I'm not a robot.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm a robot.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm a robot.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm a robot.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm a robot.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm a robot.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm a robot.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm a robot.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm a robot.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm a robot.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm a robot.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm a robot.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm a robot.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm a robot.
